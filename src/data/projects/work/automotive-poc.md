    subtitle: '40 Point Inspection'
    description: 'We built a concept around the process of a 40 point inspection in a typical auto-mechanic shop, then built a demo prototype showcasing how a voice user interface can streamline the inspection process.\nTo tell the story I brought the screens into Adobe After Effects to simulate movement in the voice user interface and illustrate the conversational aspect of the story.'
