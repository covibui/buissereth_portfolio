    subtitle: 'Retail App Suite'
    description: 'Each app in the suite was given its own user persona as each app would likely be used by different individuals within any given brand. Kristen, a Director of Retail Planning, was used for the Channel Manager app; Rodrigo, an Engagement Coordinator, was used for Broadcast, and Jamie, a Fleet Operator, was used for Fleet Operations. By working with different personas for each app, we were able to analyze and work on the interface for each app through specific lenses and were able to differentiate between the distinct capabilities of each app by targeting specific needs within the
    job at hand.'

    subtitle: 'Personas'
    description: 'Each persona then had their own distinct journeys that reflected how they would interact with their respective app which helped us plan and create the features for them. From the user journeys, we created prototypes to demonstrate to Jabil how users would interact with their systems, making each step intuitive to users so that their experience would be seamless and painless.'

    description: 'Lastly, a final persona, Monica was created to represent a Kylie Cosmetics customer that would walk up to the Edge Retail device and purchase a product. Her user journey was representative of how any consumer would interact with a kiosk and what expectations they would have while interacting with it. This allowed us to analyze how the other three personas would reach/interact with her experience.\nThe UI represents the user interface on the client devices. The goal was to have the digital UI interact with the physical space of the kiosk.'
