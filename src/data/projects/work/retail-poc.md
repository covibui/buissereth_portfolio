    subtitle: 'Retail App Suite'
    description: 'Each app in the suite was given its own user persona as each app would likely be used by different individuals within any given brand. Kristen, a Director of Retail Planning, was used for the Channel Manager app; Rodrigo, an Engagement Coordinator, was used for Broadcast, and Jamie, a Fleet Operator, was used for Fleet Operations. By working with different personas for each app, we were able to analyze and work on the interface for each app through specific lenses and were able to differentiate between the distinct capabilities of each app by targeting specific needs within the
    job at hand.'
