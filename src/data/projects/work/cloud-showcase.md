      - description: "Heuristic Evaluation\nWe started with a heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design.  We evaluated the current state of the cloud service platform to highlight the technical and usability issues. We focused on the landing page and the sign up experience because it is the front door of the entire platform experience."

      - description: 'Persona Validation\nWe talked to professionals of varying titles and backgrounds that would interact with the cloud service platform. We validated our personas with their insights. These personas were then used to model the customer journeys.'

      - description: 'USABILITY TESTING\nIn addition to the heuristic evaluation and person a validation workshops, we also conducted usability testing. Our subjects were small business owners that are giving feedback on the current state of the cloud service platform. They gave us valuable insights on how people approach the cloud service platform with or without a technical background.'

    description: 'After all the research is conducted, the team synthesized the data and insights to create new customer experience flow.\nThrough the research we concluded:\nFeedback indicated that the landing page seemed geared towards developers and lacked relevant information for a wider audience.\nWe observed mixed emotions regarding the language used in the "Credits" and "For Free" sections of the landing page.\nUsers are unclear about the purpose of the "Verification" section and would benefit from more explanation to help them understand why this step is necessary.\nThe current taxonomy of the dropdowns are not helpful for users. With this feedback we adopted changes that would alleviate these critical pain points.'

    description: 'The team created 2 prototypes reflecting the journeys of a small business owner and a large company signing up for the cloud service. The new experience enhances:\nEnhance promotional content and value-add of other GCP products on the landing page\nCustomize the content based on data input throughout within sign-up pages\nProvide transparency throughout the sign-up page process, including adding clarity in the identification verification\nImprove visual and content hierarchical throughout the entire journey\nWith another round of moderated usability tests with the same group of people, we validated our prototypes. We gathered positive feedback with potential opportunities.'
