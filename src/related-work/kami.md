KAMI is a Korean Food truck commonly found on Drexel University's University City campus. This project required conducting research via observation, user interviews, and prototype testing of the mobile application design. Keeping in mind the food truck's established brand, the task was the create a mobile application targeted towards college students and faculty that frequented the truck while taking into account their busy schedules. This includes classes, sports, and other recreational activities on campus in addition to any employment obligations that they have. The final prototype allows for users to quickly browser the food truck's menu and place an order so that they do not have to wait for extended periods of time at the truck. While not fully prototyped, consideration was put into a Korean language mode as it was the first language of many of the customers.
