This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
  - Press ctrl + j
  - Make sure you are using a bash shell, if on the right it says "powershell" and not "bash", click the down arrow next to the plus button and select "Git Bash"
2. Type `npm run dev` and press enter to start the development server.
3. When the terminal prints "ready" open http://localhost:3000 in your browser (you can hold ctrl and click on the link in the terminal)

Start editing or adding projects. Changes to `.ts` and `.tsx` will hot reload the development server automatically. Changes to other files types will likely need you to manually refresh the page to see them.
