### What is Thunk?

Thunk is a game. Our team initially started with the idea of building a creativity enhancing game. In the beginning of the project the team decided that we did not want to set ourselves on a name just yet. It was our belief that choosing a name before even starting to develop the idea of the project would greatly hamper our direction. For the first few weeks we ran with the temporary name Project Dali, named after famed artist Salvadore Dali given this Dali was selected to embody the ideals of bizarre dreams and surrealism, though the latter idea was later dropped. We anticipated the final game would be focused on creative thought and pushing the party of users outside the box. As the project developed, we outgrew the temporary name Project Dali. After long internal discussions and narrowing down a pool of names Thunk was finally settled on to embody the mood of the game, creative and thought provoking yet still maintaining a fun attitude.

### How did we make this project?

We started our research process by running Interest Interviews to ensure we were talking to users from day one of the project. These were brief five minute interviews that every member of the team conducted to ask simple questions to members of our target audience, such as what their learning styles were. We ran sample questions that would be the base of our game. We took part in a creative exercise conducted at the Rhode Island School of Design created by Industrial Design professor Cas Holman. Additionally, we gathered data as to what other party games like this people played regularly/with their friends and peers. While there was a decent spread of games that our interviewees played, there was a general interest in our project as it targeted creativity through divergent thinking.

From that information we made user personas to associate who the ideal player is. Each user persona we developed was created with our 18-25 year old college demographic in mind. Our three user personas wanted to not only flex their creative muscles, due to their college majors, but also wanted an escape from hectic college life. Some personas did not want an overly competitive game nor a game that is too complex or strenuous to setup. They also were looking for a game with a focus on social interaction and not just for points and winning. Our user personas echo our users and how they interact with Thunk as a whole.

Taking these personas we designed user journey maps to better emphasize their high points and fix their low points. Each journey map was given a similar scenario where groups of college students wanted a game that requires little to no setup. Also, a game with gameplay based around creativity was something each persona felt most comfortable with, due to the lack of an overly competitive nature associated with the game. Thunk being a game that is playable on a phone from a host device streamlines the joining and playing process which makes our personas more than happy to join in and play Thunk. Our focus was on making each user’s journey similar to these journey maps, simplified and yet extremely fun to play, at a moment’s notice.

We also performed competition research in order to better understand our expected players and our target audience. For our competition research, we looked into three games specifically, those being the following: Fibbage XL, Quiplash 2, and Drawful 2. Overall, each of the three games were focused on user interaction between the main screen and the group of players. With each game, the player’s devices had a very simplified user interface and generally only had the title of the game and any input fields required for gameplay. We noticed that each game did not rely heavily on mechanics to create fun and engaging gameplay. Instead, each game featured a unique personality. Thes personalities were created with specific color schemes, sounds, UI elements, and micro-interactions. All of these elements combine together to create this unique environment. All of these games also feature narrators that explain any instructions and reminders during the games, as well as small quips and dialogue throughout. During our playtesting of these games, we noticed that without any sound, the games lost most of their personalities and feeling. An interesting micro-interaction and small gameplay element that we all enjoyed was the ability to “heart” a favorite answer at the end of a round. While not really adding to the gameplay loop of these games, this allowed for more gratification between players, especially if players decided on funnier or out-of-the-box responses.

We interviewed two of our Game Design teaching faculty at Drexel University: Tony Rowe and Robert Lloyd. Tony gave us valuable feedback about our UXR methods involving playtesting and surveying. He suggested for us to use Likert Scales which give both easily digestible information about our game and make it so that the team can quantify change over time easily. By asking about how long players feel they were playing, we can better understand if the game felt fast or slow. We should be shooting for a time that is relatively faster than the actual game time, but not too fast. Too slow, and we can ascertain that players find the game boring. Too fast, and our game becomes unmemorable. Rob Lloyd pointed out that our game was “too normal”. This created a new challenge for us. We didn’t have any mechanics that really facilitated creativity, and Rob helped us brainstorm ways to showcase creativity while keeping our base mechanics in mind. In this meeting, we created the idea of “Switch-Ups”. This breathed new life into the game and gave us an edge over our competition. Switching out game mechanics between rounds is what we chose to keep the game fresh. Simply, we change the rules to keep people interested in the game. Though extremely random, Switch-Ups can alter game play in such a way where each time you play, something new is bound to happen. The idea behind Thunk is that the prompts and Switch-Ups will be dynamic and be a part of an ever-growing list so that a near endless amount of possibilities of rounds are available to players.

### Proof of Concept Play Testing

After our development team developed a working prototype of the think twice game mechanic, UXR went on to test this in order to gain insights on the functionality of the game and pain points we could possibly alleviate for users. In groups of two, we conducted a series of test which revealed the following about our game:

Users enjoyed anonymity: reviewing some of the answers and realizing who said what at the end of a round was one of the most exciting parts of the game.
Users enjoyed playing with friends as they felt comfortable interacting with each other and sharing inside jokes.
Too many players made the voting process lengthy and that slowed the game down. We realized no more than 8 players would be too much for people to enjoy the game.
The visuals of the proof of concept prototype were too basic and users didn’t enjoy that too much but that is understandable as there were close to no designs in the prototype.
UI Design
Designing with multiple people is very different from working alone. As a team we strived to ensure that each member was part of the team by developing ideas individually, sharing them with each member as a team and then discussing which ideas would allow users to achieve their goals in an efficient manner. This agile process allowed each of us to work together without stepping on each others toes.

We set out to project a unique visual identity that reflected our user research by focusing on color, typography, shape, and microinteractions. Our initial idea was to establish a cooler mood with our user interface whilst keeping a playful energy. We considered the game designer’s workflow in creating concept art for the project while executing IDM practices. The addition of funky personalized avatars, music and an extroverted narrator are elements which helped the game have a lighter tone whilst also keeping it fresh. We wanted to be inclusive of most devices which is why we followed responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop screens.

### Our Strategy

We adopted an agile workflow with a 3-step creative cycle for this project, aimed to improve inclusion and divide the work better allowing a scope for faster and more changes:

- **Step 1:** Create & Iterate, which means to individually work on tasks ranging from moodboards to wireframes, which meant everybody presented the same work yet brought a range of ideas to choose from.
- **Step 2:** Discuss & Evaluate, which we did in our weekly team meetings and class times. Our discussions were mainly involving what works and what doesn’t, and what is to be done moving forward to next week.
- **Step 3:** Merge Designs, meet in smaller guild meetings assigned according to task and work together to create the interface and improve upon it even further every time.

### Our Process

The team brought forward ideas and aspects we wanted to include in our mood boards. Most mood boards had many aspects in common. The group gravitated toward smooth, organic shapes with a focus on non-traditional, bright color combinations. In addition to these color combinations, we wanted a focus on the use of color and shapes in our designs moving forward.

We went through rounds of thinking through different kinds of styles and moods to convey. We had ideas based around playing with movement of the letters and altering the opacity of colored letters to see how they would interact. We eventually decided on our use of the Gilbert Bold font to use. The thick letters and curved aspects of the “u” and “n” letters play nicely with each other.

Our color systems try to stimulate an upbeat mood of the game while highlighting important areas to guide users intuitively. We did some research into color psychology and realized the effect of the two primary colors of our game. Purple denotes encouragement, inspiration and creativity. This is a core value of the game which seeks to get users thinking out of the box and be creative. The next color is pink and that deals with compassion, comfort and fun. This coincides with another value of our game which is for users to feel comfortable expressing their ideas no matter how wild. The color palette works to reflect the feeling of fun and creativity.

With our colors and mood defined, we moved into confirming our design decisions with the creation of style tiles. Within these style guides and tiles, we agreed on the typography we would use and the sizes for each of our main breakpoints. With a focus on gradients and organic shapes, our Thunk design will remain unique and ever-changing each playthrough.

Another challenge we faced and are still working at fixing is the issue of visual accessibility. Ensuring that the contrast between colors is enough for people with color blindness to distinguish.

Our wireframing process started with us sketching for Think Twice, the main game mode we are exploring in this project. A prompt is given and players are to respond to that prompt as many times within the allotted time. After which the top to responses for each player are recorded and then voted on collectively as a group. Wireframing allowed us to define the user glow and understand the core of our game by anticipating how users would navigate and interact with it. This gave us great insights for the development team to work with.

With every project, we wanted Thunk to be accessible to users and that is the reasoning behind some of our design decisions. For our font choices, we decided on using Bold Avenir Next as our header font which, while at a larger font size, allows for our users to easier progress through the visual hierarchy of each screen. We also decided on using McLaren for body text which gives a more “hand-drawn” feeling, but is not hard to read like a script-like font. While on a mobile screen, no font was smaller than 18pt so any text is easy to read. With these fonts, we usually stuck with white text on a dark blue background so none of the text would be lost. Against our dark blue background, we used our bright pink and orange colors for shapes to provide interesting visuals during gameplay. While keeping in mind different screen sizes, we made sure that each screen’s elements would be able to be scaled-up in order to effectively use screen real estate.

#### Development

We began our exploration into the world of server and backend development by making a droplet on DigitalOcean. This is a virtual server which we could use to run our game and hold all of the rooms we planned on creating. Since we knew that one of the main features of our game was the functionality of the rooms, we began looking into what languages allowed us to do this. Because we had prior experience with JavaScript and NodeJS, we decided to go with NodeJS as our primary tool for working with the server. DigitalOcean provided a series of tutorials for getting our droplet set up, so we ran through installing Nginx, Node, the Node Project Manager, Certbot, and PM2 through the Terminal. We were pretty new to running commands through the Terminal, so we struggled at first, but we slowly got accustomed to it.

##### NodeJS with Socket.IO

Initially in the project’s development, we looked at multiple scripting and server languages. All in all, we felt that PHP could not handle all of the server-based actions we needed it to, so we ended up using NodeJS. Next, we evaluated multiple databases, between multiple object-oriented and relational database structures, such as Haskell and SchemeQL. In the end we stuck with SQL. We had prior experience with it, so we thought it would have less of a learning curve than any other query language. Initially, we created a simple chatroom, which I modified, to ensure both of us understood NodeJS and Socket.IO. However, we still had to learn. Solutions that worked on a small chatroom soon were completely inadequate for a large-scale project with multiple rooms. As we pushed onwards, parts would break. We constantly went back and refactored old code when old solutions became unusable. Even though this was an excruciating and stressful experience, nothing could have taught me NodeJS and server programming more than being constantly pushed to find new solutions when old ones were inadequate. Even if it was a fight with the technology and language every time we learned more about the project and the languages we were using, the experience we gained from it is invaluable.

##### Nunjucks

As the project went further and further into development, we began to feel like our file system was looking more and more cluttered. To fix this problem, we looked into multiple HTML template engines. We had never used a template engine before. Since some of the team had prior experience with Nunjucks, we decided to use it. The engine had a slow learning curve, and we were able to adapt to it very quickly. Parts of pages which were used in multiple HTML pages were separated into partials, which could then be called back and cleaned up our files immensely. All in all, Nunjucks was very easy to comprehend, and it helped us learn more about cleaning up file structures in this project.

##### The New Repository

We began to look for more online tools to help us understand NodeJS and Socket.IO. We searched for similar projects on GitHub, hoping to find something that would help us understand the languages better. After a while, we found a free public repository that taught us important lessons about Socket.IO which are not available in its documentation. The repository taught us that we were using Express, a Node plugin, in a way that ended up creating much more problems for us than we initially realized. Though it worked for months due to odd code, the way we were utilizing Express to generate new pages on button clicks made transferring data between pages extremely difficult. Together, we spent hours reverse engineering the repository. As a team, we decided to refactor the repository to fit our needs, then to modify it to further encompass all the aspects of our game we initially pitched.

Work on Back End Development kicked back into full gear, and we crunched out many critical features with breakneck speed. In what felt like an instant, we connected the project to our SQL database. We were reading prompts and switch-ups from the database and displaying them in the game. Avatars were implemented, and styles were updated to those our User Interface team designed. All in all, this new repository turned the project from a theoretical success to a physical one.
