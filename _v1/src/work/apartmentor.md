### The Case at Hand

Many real estate web applications develop for a user base consisting of adults looking for a home for themselves or their family. Many of these apps assume the user has a full-time job and thus highlight certain requirements for buying houses such as credit score, tax statements, etc.

There is a wide population of people age 18 to 22 that are full- or part-time students looking for safe and temporary homes, especially within university settings such as Drexel. Most users in this demographic are living alone for the first time and they have little to no experience going through the process of agreeing to a lease or contract, and budgeting money accordingly.

### An Analysis of the Situation

There is a lack of real estate and budgeting resources catered to young adults or first-time renters. The goal of our app, ApartMentor, is to ease the process of finding homes for first-time renters whilst also ensuring that the user maintains financial safety and stability.

### The Problems & The Solutions

1. New renters may have difficulty considering specifications necessary for finding a suitable apartment that fits their needs. This can lead to difficulty finding a suitable apartment, mental stress on first time renters, and possibly fitting renters with an apartment that doesn’t suit their needs. The renter is responsible for doing the research to combat this problem, but the renting site or application can help in easing that process.
   1. By teaching the user / apartment renter what to search for in finding a suitable apartment, and catering the user interface to that specific group by making it easily accessible to find information important to those people, we strive to help ease the process of finding an apartment that suits a renter’s needs, including those they might not even see as there.
2. Young renters who are trying to rent an apartment with others may have difficulty coordinating between groups. The impact of this is added complexity when apartment hunting for a group. The members of a group searching for an apartment are the ones responsible for this.
   1. With the inclusion of a function which allows users to share apartments and apartment lists with others, we believe that the complexity surrounding setting up a housing situation with a group will be a problem of the past. Users can see if certain apartments fit everybody in a group’s necessities and budgets, so users can browse apartments more comfortably.
3. Young adults have a lack of experience in budgeting for everyday life. The impact of no budgeting experience can be overspending and bad monetary decisions. Though the young adults themselves are responsible for this problem, it is also an obligation of others to teach these people how to budget responsibly.
   1. A budgeting section in-app allows users to understand the total cost of living on one’s own. Secondary costs that may not be immediately apparent are brought to the user’s attention to help them understand this full cost and how to prepare for living on one’s own.

### Research Into Existing Systems

The two issues that we’ve seen resolved in other apps and websites include teaching accommodations for new renters and budgeting tools. In our similar app comparison, we mostly observed accommodations for new renters. We looked to these tutorials as potential models for our app’s Mentorship feature.

#### Zillow

Zillow presents users with an informative step-by-step tutorial when they first enter the website.

Zillow’s other notable feature is one that allows renters to contact the realtors directly. Clearly presenting the next step that’s separate from the site itself eases the process for new renters.

#### Apartments.com

Apartments.com also has a first time tutorial for their website, but we found their version to be a bit more confusing and misleading.

Apartments.com and Zillow also had included details in their listings that would be very helpful to new renters. Apartments.com includes a WalkScore, TransitScore, and SoundScore. These scores inform the renter of the walkable areas around listings, how each connects to public transit, and the noise level of the neighborhoods. Presenting important details like these clearly and concisely inspired the features we included in our own listings.

We also looked to two apps, Duolingo and Mint for examples of lessons and budgeting tools.

#### Duolingo

Duolingo features a very clear and well organized lesson pathway. Their interface design is fun and approachable, and the entire app is designed to make moving through lessons simple and fun. Also, Duolingo’s lessons feature very concise instructions. This app’s teaching strategies use gamification to make the process of learning more engaging and less of a chore. Because our app wants to help teach people the process of renting an apartment, it needs to engage them in the process. Creating a style of learning inspired by Duolingo’s will improve user retention, ensuring users learn what they need to in order to use our app. Even though we’re using gamification in our app, we’re not rewarding progress. Duolingo focuses on retaining users through daily lessons, but we use a more passive approach to lessons because the information is referential.

#### Mint

Mint is a budgeting app. Mint offered some very straightforward features for easy budgeting. This app’s design is very simple and focused. The main design ideas we were inspired by were their use of card sectioning, a color-coded pie chart with a similar-colored UI, and a simplified way of displaying information to the user. All of these were looked at to find how to make the experience clear and easy to navigate. Card styling helps visually distinguish between separate parts of the user interface so that users don’t become confused on initially visiting the application. Color-coding also supports this visual distinction and directs the user where to look when searching for specific information. The overall simplicity of the app’s design is something we hoped to replicate in our own budgeting features, which we found especially important due to the lack of experience with this our target audience has.

### Methodology for Design

![Apartmentor style tile](apartmentor-design-methodology.png)

The primary color palette consists of an orange gradient, going from **#FFB600** to **#FF7E00**, and a blue gradient going from **#00C3FF** to **#0088B3**. The use of bright oranges is to provide a distinguishable color apart from the existing competitors. Many competitive real estate apps go for a more matured color scheme, consisting of dark blues, greens, and reds, to try and appeal to an older market. Because we’re appealing to a much younger market, we can choose a more youthful orange. According to color psychology, orange provides all the positive connotations of red and yellow, without having a strong overbearing color. Orange is the balance of passion and brightness that are the qualities we are bringing to the application and the apartment hunting search in general. The orange is to provide enthusiasm for the learning process.

In contrast, there are bright blue highlights. From the analysis conducted from other existing apps, the use of only one color is dull. The blue represents the communication between the user and the interface. Blue and orange are the most popular complementary colors that do not have another connotation to relate to. Blue not only stands out from the orange visually but it also has a different meaning. The use of blue in the interface is to highlight things of importance, like a confirmation button or a tag on the map.

For typefaces, we chose three similar sans serif fonts. Our 3 fonts are Gotham, Nunito, and Open Sans. All of them are very rounded to have a very simple bubbly look. We used more approachable rounded fonts to give a more young, educational feel. ApartMentor reflects the same learning environment. Sans serif fonts are more frequently used in other designs so they appeal to younger audiences. They were chosen for the purpose of keeping its legibility in large and small sizes. Gotham was used for the logo, because its rounded interiors feel approachable, yet the straight exteriors and sharp corners make the font feel more professional as a whole. Nunito is used for headings, as it is stylistically unique and reads well in short amounts. Open Sans has great overall readability, and for this reason we used it as our regular text and description font. Open Sans is a font face that complements the Nunito headers and their styles, and can be relied on for its readability.

### App Interface

The application begins with a series of 4 questions. We initially designed these questions after viewing the tutorials for Zillow and Apartments.com. Our app is heavily focused on the educational aspect of renting an apartment for the first time. Because of this, instead of introducing the user to a tutorial of the user interface on initially opening the app, we give them approachable questions that ask about the user themself. We felt that this would give our app a small bit of personality and connection with the user, while still allowing us to gather information to cater the ApartMentor experience to what each user needs.

Question 1, “Who are you?”, helps us designate where to prioritize the user’s central location, whether it is a college campus, a workplace, or something else. Question 2, “What are you looking for", helps ApartMentor prioritize the types of listings most helpful for the user. Question 3, “Are you looking alone?” helps ApartMentor’s backend understand whether or not to introduce the app’s group searching function to the user. Finally, Question 4, “How can ApartMentor help you?” dictates how in-your-face ApartMentor’s app and apartment tutorials will be for the individual user. We felt these four questions would get us the critical information we need to make the application useful to the user without overbearing them with too much on startup.

![Screenshot of Question 2 from ApartMentor's onboarding process asking what type of property the user is looking for](apartmentor-question02.png){.w-full .max-w-sm .md:w-1/2}

From these four questions, the user is introduced to the main apartment search map. The listings are initially all shown with an **orange** place marker on the map, but when the user fills out their budget, they become a “stoplight” color scheme, representing how much of a “fit” each apartment is. Apartments that are well within the user’s budget have a **green** place marker. Those nearing the top of the user’s budget have a **yellow** place marker. Those right outside of the user’s budget have a **red** place marker. These are displayed in case the user has leniency in their budget and can go over what they put. Apartments well outside of the user’s budget are not displayed. We initially included a key alongside the map, but the style of the key looked out of place, and decided as a group that the “stoplight” color scheme was so recognizable in modern society that most users would understand what it means on initially viewing it.

From the map, the user can search for listings that fit within their criteria. Under the “Filters” tab, the user can adjust their budget, change their central location, and add or remove filters to search for. We included adjusting the budget on the top of the filters section for the cases where the user did not enter a budget on the app yet, and for when the user wants to search for apartments that are outside of their current budget. Next is central location. This is one of the most important filters because if people are searching for apartments near different colleges or job opportunities, they need this information to be easily findable and changeable. From here, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and features are available.

![Screenshot of the Filters tab available in ApartMentor to narrow search results](apartmentor-filters.png){.w-full .max-w-sm .md:w-1/2}

Features may not always be complete necessities for the user, but they’re aspects the user wants prioritized when the application organizes listings. This can include things such as if an apartment is pet-friendly or if it has nearby public parks. Through the features, apartments won’t be added or removed from the Listings tab, but the order in which they’re displayed is changed to reflect the user’s preferences. The features are typically things we thought of as luxuries for the user, and while these do hold importance to the user, the most important thing for the user is to find an affordable apartment, so we don’t want to limit their results.

When the user finishes setting up their filters and search settings, they can begin the process of looking for a suitable apartment. There are two ways to look for apartments on ApartMentor. For the more visual apartment finders, there is the Map view. For the most data-driven apartment finders, there is the Listings view. All listings are shown in both views, the difference is how they are visually displayed, whether it’s in a map or a single column. Whichever view mode the user chooses, from there they can find a single listing to view further in-detail.

By tapping on a single listing, the user can view all the details about the apartment. This includes the available features, a description, a map with nearby public transition options and amenities, a budget pie chart, apartment requirements, and a form to contact the realtor. We put the essential apartment information on the top of the listing, followed by the features, which reflects their order of importance from our Filters tab. The description, map, and budget pie chart start off collapsed, and are all expandable items. From researching apartment listings on other sites, most descriptions included information already easily accessible through other parts of an apartment listing’s page, so we felt that initially compressing it would get it out of the way for users. Since the apartment is already viewable on a map initially, we felt that having the map section initially expanded would be redundant. During our first iteration of the app, we had a function which would display the public transit route from the apartment to and from the central location, including daily, weekly, and monthly public transit rates to allow the user to consider both their commute and its effect on their budget, however, due to scope we decided to simplify the map for now. The pie chart displays how well the apartment fits in with the user’s predefined budget, and can be used as a visual aide to determine if any given apartment is a viable option. Considering factors that change per apartment, such as utility costs, can affect this pie chart, and thus an apartment’s viability. Because signing a lease is very important, but also very stressful, we included all necessary documents for signing any given apartment at the bottom of the page. Having this information easily accessible will allow the user to understand the leasing process and the terms they’re agreeing to when signing an apartment. It will also allow them to check if they can provide all necessary documentation for a listing. This information is only really necessary when a user is ready to move forward with signing an apartment, so we included it later on the apartment listing page. The user can contact the realtor from this page, which can be used to question about the apartment or schedule a showing. Finally, the user can report a listing, which helps deter against fake and suspicious listings.

From the main navigation button, which is the ApartMentor logo on the top of the app, the user can view the Lessons page. Our lessons are separated into 4 Stages: the app introduction, Looking, Renting, and Maintaining an Apartment. We chronologically organized the lessons so people won’t have to jump back and forth between them throughout the apartment finding process. Users can track their progress in each Stage from the Lessons screen, as the next lesson in each stage they must complete is the initial card facing them.

![Screenshot of the Lessons page within ApartMentor](apartmentor-lessons.png){.w-full .max-w-sm .md:w-1/2}

The final task flow the user can access on our app is Budgeting. By tapping on the Budgeting section from the navigation, the user is brought to the Budgeting page. Their monthly budget is displayed, and can be manually edited. There is a pie chart displaying all spending done by the user, color coded and separated by category. Available budgeting categories include: Rent, Utilities (separated individually), and Secondary Expenses (such as groceries and school fees). This information is useful for initially finding an apartment, but also keeps the user in the app because it becomes a lightweight money management application for handling their spending habits. Users can choose to connect it to a bank account in the Edit page, at which point it will gather information about personal spending and use that to understand what the user is overspending on and where they could afford to spend more. This is shown as a notification at the top of the page, stating “You need to cut down on \_!”. The user can then use this information to change personal spending habits.

![Screenshot of the Budgeting page within ApartMentor](apartmentor-budgeting.png){.w-full .max-w-sm .md:w-1/2}

Through our Apartment Maintenance lessons and Budgeting section, we increase our app’s longevity by increasing recurring users. It no longer is just an app for finding an apartment, but it becomes an app for maintaining an apartment and ensuring one’s financial security for living on their own for the first time. In this way, we aren’t just a simple application for finding apartments, we are an ApartMentor.
