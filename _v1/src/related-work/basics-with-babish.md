At the time of this project, the existing Binging With [Basics with Babish site](https://basicswithbabish.co/) was strong in regards to delivering content, but lacked design methodology to ensure the content is easy to scan while working in the kitchen. To improve this use case, I focused on ensuring that the ingredients as well as the time and temperature stood out from the surrounding text in each step of the recipe. The color palette was sampled from the show's set and Babish's typical wardrobe.
