CHI is an annual conference held by ACM SIGCHI for researchers and professionals from around the world to gather and discuss the latest developments in interactive technology. While the confernce itself is meant to be impressive, the webiste that was used to promote it was woefully designed. The [existing CHI 2020 website](https://chi2020.acm.org/) was incredibly flat and did not spark any sense of creativity or innovation. The redesign of the project was meant to liven the face of the conference and excite visitors as they prepared to attend.
